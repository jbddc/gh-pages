---

I'm a junior progammer currently on my last year of a Computer Science MSc. 

My interests revolve around functional programming, blockchain decentralized distributed systems and smart contracts development. 

I also have a great passion for pc hardware and tech stuff in general, so expect some rants/odes on related subjects! ðŸ˜œ

Hope you enjoy your stay.
